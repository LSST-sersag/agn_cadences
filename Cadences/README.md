* `cadences.ipynb`, `functions.py` - Reading input data and performing calculations
* `data.csv` - File with input data. Input data are OpSim realisations. Format of the file is standard CSV file with following columns: filter, fbs, realisation, ra, dec, noise, amp. Filter - choosing desired band, fbs - choosing desired OpSim realisation, realisation - name of the realisation, ra - Right ascension, dec - declination, noise - desired noise estimation in percent (default is 5%), amp - amplitude (default is 0.2).
