The impact of LSST cadences on detection of time lags andoscillations in AGN light curves

We explore effects of cadences required for determination of time lags and oscillations based on decade long-term light curvesof active galactic nuclei (AGN), with the perspective for the coming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time(LSST). Additionally, we investigate the metric for   testing the properties of the structure function (SF)   based on the sample ofartificial AGN light curves with periodic signals
